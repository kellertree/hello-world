# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.

My name is Keller Tree. I have an associates of science degree, a data analytics certificate in the social sciences and an IBM data science certificate. Through pursuing these credentials I have developed and honed my programming and analytical skills for many years. I now am seeking to put those skills to practice by taking action. Joining the developer and analyst communities and being employed in either the role of a data analyst or software developer is my present mission.
